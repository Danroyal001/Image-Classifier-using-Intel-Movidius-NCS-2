# Image-Classifier-using-Intel-Movidius-NCS-
This project is based on using Intel Movidius Neural Compute Stick (NCS) with Raspberry Pi-3 for Image Classification Application.
With the help of Intel Movidius NCS we can run any complex pre-trainet Networks in the processors with low processing capability.
This NCS functions as an efficient external processor for performing any complex neural architectures.

**Intel Movidius Neural Compute Stick(NCS)** can be used as an external GPU for the systems which cannot support for artificial intelligence based projects.
They are less-cost comparing other GPU's and can be used efficiently for most of the Deeo Learning, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence Based Projects
