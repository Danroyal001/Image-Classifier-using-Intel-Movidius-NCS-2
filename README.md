# Image-Classifier-using-Intel-Movidius-NCS-
This project is based on using Intel Movidius Neural Compute Stick (NCS) with Raspberry Pi-3 for Image Classification Application.
With the help of Intel Movidius NCS we can run any complex pre-trainet Networks in the processors with low processing capability.
This NCS functions as an efficient external processor for performing any complex neural architectures.

Intel Movidius Neural Compute Stick(NCS) can be used as an external GPU for the systems which cannot support for artificial intelligence based projects.
They are less-cost comparing other GPU's and can be used efficiently for most of the Deeo Learning, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence Based Projects
