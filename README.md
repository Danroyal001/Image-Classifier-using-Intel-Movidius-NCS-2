# Image-Classifier-using-Intel-Movidius-NCS-
This project is based on using Intel Movidius Neural Compute Stick (NCS) with Raspberry Pi-3 for Image Classification Application.
With the help of Intel Movidius NCS we can run any complex pre-trainet Networks in the processors with low processing capability.
This NCS functions as an efficient external processor for performing any complex neural architectures.
